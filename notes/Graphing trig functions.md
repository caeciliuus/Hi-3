## Cosine
- The domain of cosine functions is all real numbers, with a maximum of $y=1$ and a minimum of $y=-1$
- **Parent function**: $f(x)=a\cos(b(x-h))+k$
	- One cycle is called a period, and is defined by the equation $y=\frac{2pi}{b}$. A cycle starts at the max/min/med and finishes when it reaches that values again
	- $a$, amplitude: distance from the median to the maximum
	- $h$, phase shift: left/right transformation
	- $k$: vertical shift
	- $b$: number of cycles the graph completes in an interval of from $0$ to $2Ï€$
- To find period length, use the equation $\frac{|b|}{2\pi}$
## Sine
- The sine function is almost identical to the cosine function, as they have the same maximums and minimums, but the only difference is that the first cycle of sine starts at $(0,0)$ and the first cycle of cosine starts at $(0,1)$
- In order to make the sine and cosine graphs identical to each other, apply one of the following transformations to a function: $\sin(\theta)=\cos(\theta-\frac{\pi}{2})$ OR $\cos(\theta)=\sin(\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})$
- The parent function contains the same qualities as the qualities of cosine functions: $f(x)=a\sin(b(x-h))+h$

## Tangent & cotangent functions
- $\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$
- The tangent function has asymptotes at every median point, or $\frac{\pi}{2}+\pi n$
- Basic cycle is @ $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$
- Period: $\frac{\pi}{|b|}$
- To find the two other points besides zeroes, plug 1 and -1 into $y$
- Cotangent functions have the same values as tangent when $y=-1 \cup 1$, but the graph starts at $\frac{\pi}{2}$ instead of $0$
